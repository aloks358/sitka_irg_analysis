Indian River Stream Gauge Analysis
===

The [Indian River Stream Gauge](https://water.weather.gov/ahps2/hydrograph.php?wfo=pajk&gage=irva2) measures the height of Indian River just upstream of the bridge on Sawmill Creek Road. Indian River lies in a moderate size drainage, and the river rises quickly during periods of heavy rain and recedes quickly when the intensity of the rain diminishes. The Indian River Stream Gauge may serve as a proxy for measuring factors such as total rainfall, rate of rainfall, ground saturation, and others that are more difficult to measure directly. This analysis examines the possible correlation between the rise of Indian River and the occurrence of landslides along Sitka's road system. In a historical analysis of the period 7/2014 through 9/2019, critical factors were identified that flagged 9 high-risk periods, of which 3 landslides occurred. There were 2 landslides during this period that occurred when the stream gauge did not exceed the critical levels identified in this analysis. The goal of this analysis is to help determine whether the Indian River stream gauge can play a meaningful role in a local landslide warning system. This approach may have relevance to other landslide-prone areas with drainage characteristics similar to Indian River.
