This is a collection of plots that are generated each time the file process_hx_data.py is run.

These files are generated by Plotly. Each of these is really a giant body of JavaScript, which generates an interactive chart that can be displayed in a browser. You can't view the actual html charts on GitHub, but if you download or clone this repository and open these files in a browser, you should be able to see the visual charts.
